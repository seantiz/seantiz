  <b>Hi there!</b><br>
</p>
  <p align="center">
  I'm probably away touching grass and playing card games.
</p>

<p align="center">
  My other interests are topology (usually in Rust), linear ops and mapping the life/death hype-cycles of a product line.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Most of all... heavily motivated to help people save time.
