  <b>Hi there!</b><br>
</p>
  <p align="center">
  I'm in the Svelte Discord channel when I'm online. <br/> We're a friendly bunch on most days but no one's perfect.

<p align="center">
  My interests are topology (usually in Rust), linear ops and building tools that help products survive the hype cycle.

  Wherever you see me use LaTeX or some fancy expression for design ideas... know that I was never good at algebra when I was younger! I'm just heavily motivated by helping people save time.
