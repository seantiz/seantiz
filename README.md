  <b>Hi there!</b><br>
</p>
  <p align="center">
  I'm in the Svelte Discord channel when I'm online. <br/> We're a friendly bunch on most days but no one's perfect.

  My more esoteric interests are topology (usually in Rust), linear optimisation and building early-warning systems for products not to get lost in a hype cycle.

  Wherever you see my use LaTeX or something fancy for expressing ideals and models, I was never good at algebra when younger. I'm just heavily motivated by helping people save time.
