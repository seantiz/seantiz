  <b>Hi there!</b><br>
</p>
  <p align="center">
  I'm in the Svelte Discord channel when I'm online. <br/> We're a friendly bunch on most days but no one's perfect.

  My more esoteric interests are topology (usually in Rust), linear optimisation and building tools that help products survive the hype cycle.

  Wherever you see my use LaTeX or something fancy for expressing ideals and models, I was never good at algebra when younger. I'm just heavily motivated by helping people save time.
