  <b>Hi there!</b><br>
</p>
  <p align="center">
  I'm in the Svelte Discord channel when I'm online. <br/> We're a friendly bunch on most days but no one's perfect.

  My interests are topology (usually in Rust), linear ops and building tools that help products survive the hype cycle. 
</p>

<p align="center">
  Most of all... heavily motivated to help people save time.
