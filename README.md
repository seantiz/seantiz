  <b>Hi there!</b><br>
</p>
  <p align="center">
  I'm in the Svelte Discord channel when I'm online. <br/> We're a friendly bunch on most days but no one's perfect.
</p>

<p align="center">
  My more esoteric interests are topology (usually in Rust), linear optimisation and building persistence modules (where you map out how your work has lived and died several lifetimes over a product hype cycle - it can be a real eye opener). 
</p>

  Despite whatever those interests might make me sound like here, I was never good at algebra or maths when younger. I'm just heavily motivated by helping people save time and the maths happens to save a LOT of it, when you know how!
